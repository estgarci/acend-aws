#Acend
Acend is a full-stack (Node/Redux/React) airline website that calls a private API and displays the real-time list of flights leaving a selected airport.

The purpose of this project was to build an asthetically pleasing full-stack website and deploy it using AWS.


It has a backend that supports user authentication through Facebook or Github using Passport.js. It uses jwt tokens to handle user sessions.
