# Acend
Acend is an airline webapp
It communicates with a proprietary API and displays the real-time list of flights scheduled at an airport. The project was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed using AWS. With this project, I aim to showcase my ability to design, build and deploy a full-stack web app.

# Purpose
I was inspired by travel websites like Volaris or Expedia, they have a responsive and minimalistic design. I thought that an interactive widget would be a great way to challenge my knowledge of the MERN stack.
There are a few reasons why I think that a travel widget is a great way to learn more about the MERN stack:
1.	Animations in a responsive widget require careful state management
2.	The display of resources requires communication with a private API
3.	Favoriting a resource requires user authentication and authorization
4.	Deploying a website requires secure HTTP communications and DNS configuration
5.	Hosting a modern web app requires the use of cloud technologies like AWS
6.	A unique project requires unique solutions

These requirements make the project a great vehicle for learning.
