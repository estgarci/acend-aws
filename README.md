# Acend
[www.acend.site]Acend.site is a live airline web app.
Acend communicates with an API and displays the list of flights scheduled at any major airport. The project was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed using AWS.

# Purpose
I was inspired by travel websites like Volaris or Expedia, they have a responsive and minimalistic design. An interactive widget is a great way to challenge my knowledge of the MERN stack.

There are a few reasons why I think that a travel widget is a great way to learn more about the MERN stack:

1.	Animations in a responsive widget require careful state management
2.	The display of resources requires communication with a production-ready API
3.	Favoriting a resource requires user authentication and authorization
4.	Deploying a website requires secure HTTP communications and DNS configuration
5.	Hosting a modern web app requires the use of cloud technologies like AWS
6.	The uniqueness of the project would require unique solutions

This set of requirements, makes the project a great vehicle for learning more about the full stack.
