# Acend
[www.acend.site](www.acend.site) is a live airline web app.
Acend communicates with an API and displays the list of flights scheduled at any major airport. The project was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed using AWS.

# Purpose
I was inspired by travel websites such as [Volaris](www.Volaris.com) or [Expedia](www.Expedia.com). I used them as an example because they have a responsive and minimalistic design. 
The main objective of the project was to use it as vehicle for learning. I wanted to learn more about; JWTs, OAuth, communications with an API, state management with redux and migrating to functinoal components in React.

# What's in the stack?
### Front end
*	Used React + Boostrap
*	Managed state w/ React redux
*	Styled components w/ Bootstrap & managed CSS w/ SCSS
*	Managed animations w/ libraries like Tippy & Framer motion
*	Built a controlled form w/ validation using libraries like Formik & Yup
*	Ensured responsiveness and compatibility w/ mobile devices
### The Middle
*	Deployed using an AWS EC2 instance
*	configured server w/ Nginx
*	Configured the DNS & TLS w/ Cloudflare
### Back end
*	Built a custom RESTful API using the Express library w/ Node
*	Built an endpoint that supplies resources from an external API
*	Added support for sign up, log in & adding/deleting favorites
*	Used Mongo as a non-relational database, w/ the help of libraries like Mongoose
*	Implemented Googleâ€™s O Auth 2.0 token strategy with Passport.js
*	Used JSON Web Tokens and signed cookies to handle all authorization on the server endpoints

# Future improvements
* Refactor SCSS, define a nomanclature for classes
* Rearange the folder structure
* Implement the use of a refresh token for server authorization
* Implement Twitter's and Github's O Auth 2.0 token strategy
* Build a card that shows more details about a selected flight
* Optimize for accesibility
* Improve flight recomendations
* Add support for testing in development mode
